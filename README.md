Description
This project involves implementing logistic regression for binary classification and softmax regression for multi-class classification using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (mini-batch SGD). The assignment is focused on developing and testing these models using the provided function prototypes and datasets.

Features
Part I: Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
Implementation: Develop a logistic regression classifier optimized using mini-batch SGD.
Testing: Validate performance using provided test cases in the HW2.ipynb file.
Part II: Softmax Regression (Multinomial Classification)
Implementation: Build a softmax regression model for multi-class classification using mini-batch SGD.
Dataset: Train the model on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28-pixel images of clothing items.
Output: Classify images into 10 categories with probabilities for each class.
Testing: Validate the implementation using provided test cases and analyze results in the Jupyter Notebook.
